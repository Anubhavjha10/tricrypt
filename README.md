TriCrypt: Your Data, Only Yours

TriCrypt is a zero-knowledge, client-side encryption tool that guarantees your data privacy. All encryption and decryption operations happen entirely within your browser, meaning your secret data, password, or keys are never sent to a server.

This tool uses a unique 3-factor key derivation system (Password + Secret Answer + Secret PIN) to generate a powerful encryption key. The data is then secured using military-grade AES-256-GCM encryption, making it mathematically impossible to access without all three secret inputs.

Features

Zero-Knowledge: No server access. Your data is never seen, logged, or stored by us.

Client-Side: All code runs on your device. Works offline once the page is loaded.

3-Factor Key: Uses PBKDF2 (100,000 iterations) with three secret inputs to protect against brute-force attacks.

Single-File Application: The entire website runs from a single HTML file.

Future-Proof: Includes plans and explanations for an upcoming Developer API for end-to-end encrypted (E2EE) communication.
